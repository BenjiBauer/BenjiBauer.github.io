        <p>Bioflow teaches children and young people playfully the predator-prey-principle based on rabbits and foxes.<br>
Students slip in a position of power. They can change the weather within the  biotope or throw some parasites or hunters in it.  Thus they change the conditions on which rabbits and foxes live, getting direct feedback, how this have effect on the population and are able to trace the process precisely.  The user looks head-on the landscape and has to swipe left and right to discover the animals. For three-dimensional look we have several layers, so a parallax effect is created when you move it.

<p>All this runs on a great touch table using Processing (Java). At it is designed for museums and exhibitions and it was exposed in „Schloss Fechenbach“ in Dieburg at the exhibition „Medien und Umwelt“ (Media and environment) for a month.<br>
This was the first major project that I have developed in a team. During development I have done nearly the hole programming part, designed the navigation and symbols and I took almost every picture, seen in the landscape.
