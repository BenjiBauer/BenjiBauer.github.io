  		<h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Personally, with my study program I have already found exactly what I was looking for. I want to develop things, which improve our lifes remarkably in the future, enthuse people with technology, plan projects precisely and implement them too. I did not learn to program until I started to study, but  I became adept in it since then. I really enjoy it, am motivated to learn more therein. In addition to my studies, I use what I have learned and make my own little projects as a hobby.<br>
Furthermore I love to photograph and then improve or even at times defacing these photos using Photoshop. I take a lot of these photos while cycling through my town or while I am traveling.<br>
In all projects I participate in I am highly motivated and always try to make the most out of them.</p><br>
        
        <h1>About my study path</h1>
        <p>A lot of people never heard about my study path „Interactive Media Design“.
It is about how we design our future and, for instance improve our everyday lives through interactive things. This ranges from a simple website or app up to the „Internet of Things“ and „Ambient Intelligence“.<br>
       It consists of a mixture of computer sciences / technology, design, management, linked to strategy, it offers a great insight into the world of interactive media. <br>
Besides the lectures we work in small groups and create a project on a given topic each semester. First we start with an idea, do research about it, build a detailed and well elaborated concept and develop a prototype for it. Teamwork is essential for success. Along with some large public presentations we do small presentations about our intermediate state every week, where we get feedback from the professors and also from the other students.
<br>
The lessons and teaching are in german as well as in english.
