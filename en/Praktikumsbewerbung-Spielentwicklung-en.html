        <p>During my studies I have completed two courses in which I developed games by using unity.</p><br>
        <p>The first course was titled „Serious Games“ and had the goal of developing a game with a serious background. The result was a 25 minutes playable prototype in which you play a little boy, named Niko, in a poor slum in the future, which is controlled by the „upper classes“. The technique in this world is highly developed, so it is hard to distinguish between man and machine. In course of the game Niko finds out, that himself is a robot as well.<br>
Here I have co-developed in many parts despite the big team: At the beginning I helped creating the main story, designed many 3D-objects like houses and  items, I have done most of the programming and also created music and sound effects.</p>

<br>
The second course had the aim to reinterpret an old flash browser game („Conquer Antarktika“) and develop a game for a mobile platform.<br>
You play against each other in two ant teams that shoot each other. Object of play is to get as much cake as possible until the end of the game. The upper ants are able to shoot, while the lower ants collect the cake automaticly.<br>
We were just two people in this project, so I have done all the programming and sound effects. My fellow student has done the whole design and the background music. <br>
The result was a fully playable prototype, which worked on the iPad.
